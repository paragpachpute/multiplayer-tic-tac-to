Of course. Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Super Tic-Tac-Toe or Nested Tic-Tac-Toe, is a significantly more complex and strategic version of the classic game. Here's a detailed breakdown of the rules:

### The Board

Imagine a large 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. Now, inside each of those nine large squares, there is a smaller, complete 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. This creates a total of 81 individual squares to play on.

### The Objective

The ultimate goal is to win the large 3x3 board. You win the large board by winning three of the smaller boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, just like in classic tic-tac-toe.

### The Core Rule: The "Forced Move"

This is the most important rule and what makes the game so strategic. **The square you choose to play in on a small board dictates which small board your opponent must play in next.**

For example:

* Let's say you place your 'X' in the **top-right** square of one of the small boards.
* Your opponent must now make their move in the small board located in the **top-right** square of the large board.

This creates a fascinating dynamic where every move you make is both an attempt to win the current small board and a strategic decision to send your opponent to a specific area of the larger board.

### How to Win a Small Board

You win one of the nine small boards by getting three of your marks (X's or O's) in a row, column, or diagonal within that specific small board. Once a small board is won, a large 'X' or 'O' is placed in the corresponding square of the main 3x3 grid to signify the victory. No more moves can be made in a small board that has been won.

### What Happens if a Small Board is Full?

If a small board is filled with X's and O's and neither player has achieved three in a row, that small board is considered a draw or "cat's game." It does not count towards either player's goal of winning three in a row on the large board.

### Special Rule: What if a player is sent to a small board that is already won or full?

This is a crucial rule. If your opponent sends you to a small board that has already been won or is full (a draw), you are then free to make your move in **any of the other available small boards on the entire grid.** This is a significant advantage, as it gives you a "wild card" move to play anywhere you see fit.

### How the Game Ends

The game ends in one of two ways:

1.  **A player wins:** A player successfully wins three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the large 3x3 grid.
2.  **A draw:** If the entire large board is filled with won boards and drawn boards, and no player has achieved three in a row, the game is a draw. This can also happen if a stalemate is reached where no legal moves can be made.

### A Simple Walkthrough of the First Few Moves

1.  **Player 1 (X)** starts the game by placing an 'X' in any of the 81 squares. Let's say they choose the center square of the center small board.
2.  **Player 2 (O)** is now forced to play in the center small board (because Player 1 played in the center square). Player 2 places their 'O' in the top-left square of that center small board.
3.  **Player 1 (X)** is now forced to play in the top-left small board. They place their 'X' in the bottom-right square of that top-left small board.
4.  **Player 2 (O)** must now play in the bottom-right small board, and so on.

This back-and-forth continues, with each player trying to win the small board they are in while simultaneously considering where their move will send their opponent next. The strategy lies in forcing your opponent into boards you are close to winning or boards where they have limited good moves.
